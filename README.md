# Leopard

A high performance, Swift 4 Web Framework with a great API.

<<<<<<< HEAD
We're still in beta, and will release when Swift 4 is released and the framework is meeting the following criterea.

[x] Insanely fast
=======
We're still in beta, and will release after Swift 4 has been release.

The framework must be meeting the following criterea as part of the OpenKitten goals:

- [x] The fastest
- [x] Complete asynchronous support
- [x] Customizable for complex use cases
- [x] Amazing docs
- [x] The most powerful features
- [x] No unnecessary dependencies
- [x] Integrate with the Swift ecosystem
- [x] Download and compile, that's it, no dependencies except Swift \*\*
- [ ] Completely tested
- [ ] The syntax is so clean and simple that you almost forgot it's not the standard library
- [ ] Extensive production testing

And striving for the following goals by design, too:

- [ ] So complete that 'batteries included' is an understatement
- [ ] Programming a website in assembly would give you slower performance
- [ ] [Why are you still looking here?! Get started!](http://openkitten.org/beta/site/leopard/)

\*\* OpenSSL is required on Linux for SSL support.
