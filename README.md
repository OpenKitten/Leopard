Leopard is currently in beta, with a planned release alongside Swift 4's official release.

In following OpenKitten's goals, Leopard's criteria are:

- [x] The fastest Swift web framework
- [x] Simple enough for beginners, and extensive enough for experts
- [x] Quick setup: download and compile
- [x] No dependencies except Swift*
- [x] Beautifully clear documentation
- [x] Complete asynchronous support
- [x] Customizable for complex use cases
- [x] The most powerful features
- [x] Integrate with the Swift ecosystem
- [ ] Syntax so clean and simple it feels like the standard library
- [ ] Completely tested
- [ ] Extensive production testing

By design:

- [ ] So complete that 'batteries included' is an understatement
- [ ] Better performance than a website programmed in assembly
- [ ] [What are you waiting for?! Get started!](http://openkitten.org/beta/site/leopard/)
